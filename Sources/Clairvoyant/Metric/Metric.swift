 A metric is a single piece of state that is provided by an application.
 Changes to the state can be used to update the metric,
 which will propagate the information to the collector for logging and further processing.

 The generic type can be any type that conforms to `MetricValue`,
 meaning it can be encoded/decoded and provides a description of its type.
